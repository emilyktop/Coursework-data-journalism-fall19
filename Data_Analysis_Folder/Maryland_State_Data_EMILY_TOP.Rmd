```

```{r}
# store one of our API keys as an object called key
key <- "uO4EK6I"
```

Clear old data in in environment
```{r}

#Create a file for Maryland population per year by county
maryland_population <- county_population(key = key) %>%

```
Allegany, Cecil and Kent had high numbers of pills per person across the time period. Cecil had a large drop in 2012. What happened?


The Rural Maryland Council, which is a part of the Maryland state government, defines the following counties as rural in Maryland: Allegany, Calvert, Caroline, Carroll, Cecil, Charles, Dorchester, Frederick, Garrett, Harford, Kent, Queen Anne’s, Somerset, St. Mary’s, Talbot, Washington, Wicomico and Worcester (https://rural.maryland.gov/the-rural-maryland-council/).

```{r}
#Create a column defining each county as either rural or urban in Maryland. 
maryland_rural_urban <- maryland_pills_per_person_per_year %>%
  mutate(rural_or_urban = case_when(
    buyer_county == "ALLEGANY" ~ "rural",
    buyer_county == "CALVERT" ~ "rural",
    buyer_county == "CAROLINE" ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "CARROLL" ~"rural",

    buyer_county == "WASHINGTON" ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "WICOMICO" ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "WORCESTER" ~ "rural",
    TRUE ~ "urban"
  ))

```

```{r}
#do rural and urban areas have different pills per person over the 7 years?

maryland_rural_urban %>%
  group_by(buyer_county, rural_or_urban) %>%
  summarise(county_total_pop = sum(population), county_total_pills = sum(total_pills)) %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  summarise(group_total_pop = sum(county_total_pop), group_total_pills = sum(county_total_pills)) %>%
  mutate(group_pills_per_person = group_total_pills/group_total_pop)
  



```

Given Maryland's definition of "rural," there is a significant difference in the pills per person in rural areas as compared to the pills per person in urban areas. 


```{r}
#using census definition of rural
maryland_rural_urban2 <- maryland_pills_per_person_per_year %>%
  mutate(rural_or_urban = case_when(
    buyer_county == "CARROLL" ~"rural", 
    buyer_county == "DORCHESTER" ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "GARRETT"  ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "KENT"  ~"rural",
    buyer_county == "TALBOT" ~"rural",
    TRUE ~ "urban"
  ))

```

```{r}
#do rural and urban areas have different pills per person over the 7 years? using census definition

maryland_rural_urban2 %>%
  group_by(buyer_county, rural_or_urban) %>%
  summarise(county_total_pop = sum(population), county_total_pills = sum(total_pills)) %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  summarise(group_total_pop = sum(county_total_pop), group_total_pills = sum(county_total_pills)) %>%
  mutate(group_pills_per_person = group_total_pills/group_total_pop)

```

Given the census's definition of "rural," the difference between rural and urban is not as large, but there is still a higher number of pills per person in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

Pills per person, over the years, in Maryland gradually increased but saw a slight decrease in 2012, overall.


Rural areas are generally know to be poorer. I want to test this theory to see if the poorer counties had a higher influx of pills than the wealthier counties. This analysis below will be for just 2012.

The USDA has definitions for metro (urban) and nonmetro (rural) areas. "The official Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three metro and six nonmetro categories." (Source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx#.UYJuVEpZRvY)

Throughout the country, rural areas had a significantly higher number of pills per person over the ARCOS database timeline as compared to urban areas.

  mutate(group_deaths_per_pop = (group_total_deaths/ group_total_pop)*1000)
#deaths per 1000 people?

```

If my calculations are correct, for the entire country, rural areas have a higher death rate to opioids than urban areas

What about in Maryland?

```{r}

pills_deaths_rural$age_adjusted_rate <- as.numeric(pills_deaths_rural$age_adjusted_rate)

pills_deaths_rural %>%
  filter(buyer_state.x == "MD") %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  count(rural_or_urban)


```

```{r}
#count w/ filter of NA
pills_deaths_rural %>%
  filter(buyer_state.x == "MD") %>%
  filter(!is.na(age_adjusted_rate)) %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  count(rural_or_urban)

```

Given the available data of rural and urban opioid deaths, for those with accurate / available information, there are only 7 in the rural category as compared to 126 in the urban category, making the rates basically not comparable. 


```{r}
#join death information with maryland information

maryland_opioids <- maryland_rural_urban %>%
  inner_join(opioid_deaths, by=c("countyfips.x"="county_code"))

maryland_opioids %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  count(rural_or_urban)

```

```{r}

maryland_opioids %>%
  filter(!age_adjusted_rate== "Unreliable") %>%
  group_by(rural_or_urban) %>%
  count(rural_or_urban)

```

Using Maryland's definition of "rural" v "urban", over 30 bits of data are labeled "unreliable," i.e. missing.  


Utilizing census tracts may give a better idea of the rural v urban differences. Census tracts will break down areas better especially for counties with rural and urban areas.

```{r}
#download raw pharmacy data
maryland_pharmacies <- pharm_counties(state= "MD", key=key)

```

```{r}
#download arcos pharm tracts
acros_tracts <- pharm_tracts(key=key)

```

```{r}
#combining data with census tracts

tract_pills <- read.csv("tract_pills.csv")

```


***Below is not used***
```{r}
#join maryland pharmacies and acros tracts

```

```{r}

  summarise(group_total_pop = sum(total_2010_population), group_total_pills = sum(total_pills)) %>%
  mutate(group_pills_per_person = group_total_pills/ group_total_pop)

```

Inner ring areas have the highest pills per person. These areas include places just outside large metropolitan areas. The next highest group is then outer ring, then rural. Urban areas received the lowest pills per person by census tract in the state.

Questions for Sean:
-How do I create the average pills per year for each county? --> 
-Is there any way to do the income analysis over the seven year period? --> use income median average over the period
-Who are good people to contact and interview?
-Maryland Health Department, Public Health Research in Rural Areas, academic research papers (for potential variables)

--Why is it higher in rural areas?
( Source: https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/pmc/articles/PMC3935688/pdf/AJPH.2013.301709.pdf)
-rural areas had higher prescription rates -> increased availability
-age: rural areas generally have older populations -> chronic pain which is managed by opioids
-embedded in culture
-out migration of younger population -> strains economy b/c older workforce and less new economic infrastructure & selection effect, meaning the younger people who do stay in rural/ less economically strong areas may be more likely to develop risk factors that lead to drug use.
-closer community ties plus economic pressure strains social network -> more likely to use drugs, but strong social ties may be a buffer against drug use so more research is necessary.
-family ties -> prescription drugs are more likely to be legally obtained by friends & family 
-structural factors -> more likely to have economic downturns and deprivation, loss/ change of structure of industry in America/ mismatch of skills to available jobs in the area, longer term unemployment and lower likelihood of upward mobility, lower wages for low-skill work

-according to this study, after controlling for basic demographic factors, being in a rural area (or rurality as the name the variable) appeared to increase illict drug use
-familial norms -> experienced prescription drug use with family or friends -> but their study did not find this to affect their results
-primary sources of drugs in rural areas was actually from drug users, not family
-rural participants had higher reports of phsyical and mental health issues as well as drug and alcohol use problems in the last 30 days
-seeking medical help for medical problems were not listed as something important to rural participants, but there were no differences between rural and urban regarding seeking help for mental, drug or alcohol problems
-higher use of hydrocodone and OxyCotin in rural areas

-education, unemployment rate by county, disability
-institute for rural jounalism and community issues


For maryland 
-shipments by census tract, pull down maryland raw data, table for the census tract for each pharmacy, compute pills by census tract



Next steps:
-Linear regression model? data camp
-predict pills per person, or death rate, or both
-> I have done some data camp exercises for this.
-Opioid death data 
-Why?
