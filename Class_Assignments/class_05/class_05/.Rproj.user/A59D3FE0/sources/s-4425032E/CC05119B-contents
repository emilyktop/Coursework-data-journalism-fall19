## Objective

The purpose of this in-class assignment is to build on the information you learned in last week's in-class lab:

* Light data cleaning by renaming column names.
* Create new columns in our data set based on information in other columns.   
* Summarizing raw data, calculating min, max, median and mean values, essentially using R to create a pivot table, like we learned in Google Sheets.
* Using GitHub to upload. 
* Working with data on opioid shipments in the U.S.

## Tasks, Turning it In, Getting Help

At several points throughout this document, you will see the word **Task**.  

This indicates that you need to do something, generally creating a code block and writing custom code.  

When you are finished, you should save your R markdown file and Knit it as an HTML file.

Upload links to your GitHub folder on ELMS. 

Need help?  You are welcome to do the following things:

* Refer to the previous week's lab.
* Use Google or search Stack Overflow. Try searching for your error message or translating your problem into basic terms.
* Check out the excellent [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
* Take a look at the [Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and [Tidyverse documentation](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
  * [RStudio cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ide)
  * [Readr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf) and [Readr documentation](https://readr.tidyverse.org/).
  * [Dplyr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and [Dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
* After you've spent 5 minutes trying to solve the problem on your own, ask your neighbor and if they don't know, ask me!

## Setup

Take the following steps to set up your document:

1. Download the ZIP file and open the folder inside of your GitHub class assignments folder. It should contain this document, class_04.Rmd, and a data folder with one TSV.
2. Open this file in RStudio.
3. Rename this file "class_04_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.Rmd".
4. Create a new R project inside of this folder, which will set the working directory in this folder.   

## Load Packages

Generally, it's good practice to load packages you wish to work with at the beginning of your R markdown file.  

**Task**: Create a code block below, write and execute the simple function to load the Tidyverse family of packages and the janitor package. 

```{r}
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

```
## Load Data

For this exercise, we will be working with a small subset of the DEA's ARCOS database, which documented shipments of 76 billion opioid pills between 2006 and 2012, during the peak of the opioid epidemic. We will be working with a subset of shipments to Baltimore City, Maryland.  

The data was obtained after a lengthy legal battle by the Washington Post and the Charleston Gazette-Mail, and released by the Washington Post in raw and aggregated form. [Washington Post "Digging into the DEA's pain pill database" page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).

There is one record (row or observation) per transaction (a shipment from a manufacturer to a distributor to a pharmacy. A data dictionary is available here: [ARCOS Registrant Handbook](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/handbook/full.pdf).

**Task**: Create a code block below, and write and execute the function to load in the data of shipments to Baltimore City, Maryland and store it as an object called baltimore. Write a comment describing what you are doing.  

```{r}
#load data from working directory-- Documents/GitHub/Class_Assignments/class_04
baltimore <- read_tsv("data/arcos-md-baltimore-city-24510-itemized.tsv")

```
## Examine the Data

Now that the data is in, spend some time examining it.

**Task**: Create a code block below, and write and execute a function to open and view the spreadsheet in a new window tab that you can examine.  In that browser window, use your mouse to sort by a handful of columns, highest to lowest and lowest to highest.  In that browser window, practice turning on filters with your mouse to examine a subset of the data.

```{r}
#view baltimore data in separate tab
#View(baltimore)


```

**Task**: Create a code block below and use the glimpse and summary function to examine the shape of the data. Answer each of the following questions in a comment inside the code block:
* How many rows does the data have? How many columns?   
* Each column is stored in one of two formats: "chr", or strings of characters, generally used for text; and "dbl", a number format on which mathematical operations can be performed.  Do you see any examples of a column stored as a "dbl" that doesn't really need to be, because we would never do math on it? Are there any columns stored as character that you think should be stored in another format entirely?
* Based on the information here, how are missing values represented in this data set?

```{r}
#glimpse and summarize data
glimpse(baltimore)
summary(baltimore)

#There are 290,908 rows of data
#columns that are "dbl" that probably shouldn't be: Reporter_Zip, Buyer_Zip, Transaction_ID, and Drug_Code because these columns won't be used in mathematical equations
#columns that are stored as character that probably shouldn't be: Strength
#missing values are represented as "null"

```
## Cleaning
**Task**: Using the function from the janitor package we learned in the last lab, convert all of the column names to lower case.

```{r}
#convert uppercase column names to lower case
baltimore  <- clean_names(baltimore)

``` 

## Analysis

**Task**: Which single pharmacy **location** had the most pills sent to it? Produce the code to answer this question in a codeblock below. 

Hint: you'll need to group by more than just the pharmacy name to answer this question correctly.

Do some quick web research/reporting.  What actions did the DEA and state of Maryland take against this pharmacy? Why did they do it? 

In a comment inside the codeblock, write a paragraph (two to three sentences) that you could drop into a news story that includes the following information: Name and approximate location of the pharmacy; how many pills it received between 2006 and 2012; and a brief description of what actions the DEA and Maryland took against the pharmacy and why. 

```{r}
baltimore %>% 
                    group_by(buyer_name, buyer_address1) %>%
                    summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
                    arrange(desc(total_pills))

#Newcare Home Health Services-- A federal judge in Maryland charged the owners of the NewCare Home Health Services in 2007 with illegally selling 10 million pills of hydrocodone, laundering $20 mil., and failing to pay taxes. The company received 6,133,600 pills between 2006 and 2012. 
```


**Task**: What is the name of the distributor that was responsible for sending the most pills to Baltimore City betwen 2006 and 2012? Produce the code to answer this question in a codeblock below.  

In a comment inside the codeblock, write the following information: the name of the distributor; the number of pills sent between 2006 and 2012; the state where their corporate headquarters is located.   

```{r}
#which distributer sent the most number of pills? Group by distributer (reporter) name, and by state To get the sum of all dosage_units, sum dosage unit into a new variable called total_pills and arrange from highest to lowest

baltimore %>% group_by(reporter_name, reporter_state) %>%
  summarise(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))

#McKesson Corporation in Maryland sent the most number of pills between 2006 and 2012. The Maryland branch sent 49,834,830 pills over that time period. 

```

**Task**: Let's look only at shipments sent by the distributor in the answer to the previous question.  Which **single pharmacy location** recieved the most shipments from that distributor.  Produce the code to answer this question in a codeblock below.  

In a comment inside the codeblock, write the name and address of the buyer and the total number of shipments during the covered period.  What is unique about this pharmacy that might explain the high number of shipments?

```{r}
#Group by buyer name and address to get a single pharmacy, filter by distributor name, summarize shipments
baltimore %>% 
  filter(reporter_name == "MCKESSON CORPORATION") %>%
  group_by(buyer_name, buyer_address1) %>%
  summarize(shipments= n())%>%
  arrange(desc(shipments))

#The name of the buyer is Professional Pharmacy Service, and they are located at Sinai Hospital. They received 6254 shipments. They may receive more shipments than other places because they are a hospital and may use the drugs on a schedule that is unknown to them, so they may require more shipments.


```

**Task**: Of all the pills sent to Baltimore City between 2006 and 2012, which entity had the highest percentage of all pills sent to it. Group only by the name of the pharmacy for this question. Produce your answer in a codeblock below.

In a comment inside the codeblock, put the name of the entity, the percentage of pills it was responsible for, the total number of pills sent to it and the total number of pills sent to the whole city. 

```{r}
# Group by buyer name. Summarize all pills for each pharmacy, then create a new column to create total pills in the city. Once those two columns have been created, create the percentage pills column by dividing all_pills by total_pills_city, multiply by 100 and round to two decimal places. Arrange pharmacies from highest to lowest by percentage_pills

baltimore %>% 
  group_by(buyer_name) %>%
  summarize(all_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  mutate(total_pills_city = sum(all_pills)) %>%
  mutate(percentage_pills = round(((all_pills/total_pills_city)*100),2))%>%
  arrange(desc(percentage_pills))

#Rite Aid of Maryland, Inc. was responsible for 12.52% of the pills. It had  16,740,590 pills sent to its various stores throughout the city. The total number of pills in the city was 133,721,503.
```

**Task**: Being a good data journalist who has worked with messy data, you are skeptical that the percentage you got for the last question -- "RITE AID of MARYLAND INC." -- truly represents all shipments to Rite Aid pharmacies in the city.  

In a codeblock below, copy the function you wrote in your previous answer and add a filter at the end that returns only those records that have "RITE" in the name.  In a comment, explain how many different iterations of Rite Aid there are in this data set.  What prevented them from grouping correctly?  

```{r}
baltimore %>% 
  group_by(buyer_name) %>%
  summarize(all_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  mutate(total_pills_city = sum(all_pills)) %>%
  mutate(percentage_pills = round(((all_pills/total_pills_city)*100),2))%>%
  arrange(desc(percentage_pills)) %>%
  filter(str_detect(buyer_name, "RITE"))

#There are three different iterations of Rite Aid of Maryland in the data set. They weren't grouped correctly because they had differences in names in the buyer_name column.

```

**Task**: Create a codeblock below that does the following.

* Creates a new column in the data set called "rite_aid_y_n".  In that column, make the value say "rite_aid_y" if the buyer_name column indicates the store is a rite aid.  Make the value say "rite_aid_n" if it's not.  

* Group by the newly created column, allowing us to examine shipments to Rite Aid and shipments to everyone else.   

* Calculates the total number of shipments to each group, the total shipments to the city as a whole, and the percentage of total shipments each group is responsible for. 

In a comment inside the codeblock, explain how many total shipments there were to the city, how many and what percentage went to Rite Aid stores.

```{r}
baltimore %>%
  mutate(rite_aid_y = case_when(
    buyer_name == "RITE AID OF MARYLAND, INC." ~ "rite_aid_y",
    buyer_name == "RITE AIDE OF MARYLAND INC" ~ "rite_aid_y",
    buyer_name== "RITE AID OF MARYLAND, INC T/A" ~ "rite_aid_y",
    TRUE ~ "rite_aid_n")) %>%
  group_by(rite_aid_y)%>%
  summarize(shipments= n())%>%
  mutate(total_shipments_city = sum(shipments)) %>%
  mutate(percentage_shipments = round(((shipments/total_shipments_city)*100),2))

#There were 290,908 shipments to the city of baltimore. There were 41,744 shipments to Rite Aid stores, which makes up 14.35%.

```
**Task**: Create a summary table with the following information:

* Looks only at Hydrodocode pills
* Creates a new column called "pipeline" with "the pipeline" for each shipment: one manufacturer to one distributor to one pharmacy. Just use the name of each for this. In this new column you create, separate with two hyphens --
* The following summary stats: total shipments, total pills, average pills per shipment, largest shipment (in terms of pills).
* Sort by different summary columns.  

In a comment, write up your findings.  What information would you use to spur additional reporting? 

```{r}
baltimore %>%
  filter(drug_name == "HYDROCODONE") %>%
  mutate(pipeline = paste(combined_labeler_name, reporter_name,  buyer_name, sep="--")) %>%
  group_by(pipeline) %>%
  summarize(shipments= n(),total_pills=sum(dosage_unit),
          average_pills_shipment=total_pills/shipments, max_pills=max(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_pills_shipment))
  
#SpecGx, LLC manufactured pills that were sent to Rite Aid Mid-Atlantic who distributed pills to Rite Aid of Maryland, Inc. This combination of manufacturer to distributor to pharmacy had the highest number of total pills compared to all other combinations. They had 2,482,900 pills. 

#The combination of Actavis Pharma, Inc. to Cardinal Health to NewCare Home Health Services had the largest shipment in terms of pills. This combination also had the highest number of pills per shipment of 14,285.



```

**Task**: The discovery, in the previous question, that there was at least one shipment of Hydrocodone from Actavis Pharma to Cardinal Health to NewCare Home Health Services of 48,000 pills prompts you to want to learn more.  On what date did this transactions take place? Write the code you'd use in a codeblock below. In a comment, put the date.

```{r}
baltimore %>%
  filter(drug_name == "HYDROCODONE") %>%
  mutate(pipeline = paste(combined_labeler_name, reporter_name,  buyer_name, sep="--")) %>%
  group_by(pipeline, transaction_date) %>%
  summarize(max_pills=max(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_pills))

#This transaction of 48,000 pills happened on March 21, 2006.

```
## Further analysis

**Task**: Based on your initial analysis, NewCare Home Health Services seems worthy of additional digging.  You set out to learn as much as you can about their patterns.  Use everything you've learned to get at these or other questions:What were their buying patterns like?  Did they concentrate on buying certain kinds of pills? Were they buying greater numbers of high dose opioids, compared to others? Who made most of the pills they got?  Who distributed them?

Create four separate codeblocks below. Ask and answer at least four separate questions. 

```{r}
#What type of pills did NewCare Home Health Services buy?
  
  baltimore %>%
    filter(buyer_name == "NEWCARE HOME HEALTH SERVICES")%>%
    mutate(hydrocodone_y = case_when(
    drug_name == "HYDROCODONE" ~ "hydrocodone_y",
    TRUE ~ "hydrocodone_n")) %>%
    group_by(hydrocodone_y) %>%
    summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
    mutate(total_pills_city=sum(total_pills)) %>%
    mutate(percentage_pills = round(((total_pills/total_pills_city)*100),2))

#Nearly 100% of the pills sent to NewCare Home Health Services were of hydrocodone.
```

```{r}
#Which distributor sent NHHS the most pills? In what state was that distributor?

baltimore %>%
  filter(buyer_name == "NEWCARE HOME HEALTH SERVICES")%>%
  group_by(reporter_name, reporter_state)%>%
  summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))

#Anda Pharmaceuticals Inc in Ohio sent NewCare Home Health Services the most pills. It sent NHHS 1,928,500 pills.

```

```{r}
#Which pipeline sent the most pills to NHHS?

baltimore %>%
  filter(buyer_name == "NEWCARE HOME HEALTH SERVICES")%>%
  mutate(pipeline = paste(combined_labeler_name, reporter_name,  buyer_name, sep="--")) %>%
  group_by(pipeline, reporter_state) %>%
  summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))

#The combination of Actavis Pharma, Inc. to Anda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (in Ohio) sent the largest number of pills to NHHS. They sent 1928500 pills. However, Anda Pharmaceuticals may be larger because there appears to be an Anda, Inc. in Florida and Anda Pharmaceuticals in Ohio. 

```

```{r}
#Which pipeline sent the highest average number of pills per shipment? In which state was the distributor?

baltimore %>%
  filter(buyer_name == "NEWCARE HOME HEALTH SERVICES")%>%
  mutate(pipeline = paste(combined_labeler_name, reporter_name,  buyer_name, sep="--")) %>%
  group_by(pipeline, reporter_state) %>%
  summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit), shipments= n(), average_pills_shipment=total_pills/shipments) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_pills_shipment))

#Actavis Pharma, Inc to Cardinal Health sent the highest average number of pills to NHHS per shipment, an average of 14,285 pills. Cardinal Health sent its pills from New Jersey.
