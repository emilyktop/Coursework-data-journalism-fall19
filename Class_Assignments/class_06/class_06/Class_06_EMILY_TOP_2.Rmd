## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load tinyverse, janitor, and lubridate
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(arcos)

```

```{r}
#load statewide data
state<- read_tsv("arcos-md-statewide-itemized.tsv")
```

```{r}
#clean data
 state<- clean_names(state)

```


```{r}
#glimpse at data
glimpse(state)
```

There are over 3 million observations with 42 variables.

```{r}
#total pills per county
state %>%
  group_by(buyer_county) %>%
  summarise(total_pills= sum(dosage_unit))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))

```


```{r}
# store a password as an object called key
key <- "uO4EK6I"
```

```{r}
#Check county population data with that online with acros
MD_county_pop <- county_population(state="MD", key=key)

```

```{r}
#Create county averages for population
MD_county_pop_avg <-
  MD_county_pop %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  mutate(county_pop_avg= mean(population))



```

```{r}
#combine population data and state data
MD_county_pop_avg <- clean_names(MD_county_pop_avg)
```

```{r}
#glimpse at county population data
glimpse(MD_county_pop_avg)

```

```{r}
#join population data with state data
state_population <- state %>%
  inner_join(MD_county_pop_avg, by ="buyer_county")

```

```{r}
#Create a county pills/ person rate
state_pop_rate <- state_population %>%
  select(buyer_county, dosage_unit, county_pop_avg) %>%
  group_by(buyer_county) %>%
  mutate(total_county=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  mutate(rate=total_county/county_pop_avg) %>%
  arrange(desc(rate))

```


```{r}
#view pills per person
state_pop_rate %>%
  group_by(buyer_county) %>%
  summarize(rate1=min(rate)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rate1))


```

Kent County had the highest rate of pills per person over the time period, given the average population of the time and the number of pills in the area. **CHECK WITH SEAN BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT MATCH UP TO WAPO NUMBERS**

```{r}
#Trying to figure out how WaPo got their numbers of pills per person per year
state_population %>%
  select(buyer_county, dosage_unit, county_pop_avg) %>%
  group_by(buyer_county) %>%
  mutate(total_county=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  mutate(total_county_peryear= total_county/7)%>%
  mutate(rate2=total_county_peryear/county_pop_avg) 


```

```{r}
#pharmacies with the highest number of pills over time
state %>%
  group_by(buyer_name, buyer_address1, buyer_city) %>%
  summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))


```

```{r}
state %>%
  filter(str_detect(transaction_date == 2006)) %>%
  group_by(buyer_county) %>%
  summarize(total_pills=sum(dosage_unit)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pills))
  

```
